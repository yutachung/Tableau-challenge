## Overview of Analysis
     We have taken the values in a csv file from the Citi Bike page and have visualized the data into
various graphs that communicate the significance of the extracted information. We are able to organize
the various categories of data and try to find a relationship between the points of data.

## Results
     In the starting and ending locations of trips, we are able to qualitatively understand where users
begin and end their trips by looking at the size of the locations. The bigger the circle, the more users
come to those locations to begin or end their trip. The following two graphs display that most users will
not be using the service for more than 40 minutes. The several graphs that follow exemplify that there
are more males than females that use the bikes in both weekdays and time of day. This also applies when
comparing users and subscribers of the bike service. Male subscribers are more likely to use the bikes than
female subscribers, and will also apply to males and females customers respectively. 

## Summary
     When observing the data, we must first understand that the portion of data that we have visualized
pertains to August 2019. There are many things to consider and question when looking at the results of
the data. To begin, when taking a look at the starting and ending locations of the trip, could these
areas be attracting a high traffic of users because it is the summer time and tourist locations are popular?
Another thing to consider could be to also consider people who are not working in the summer time such as
children, tourists, and older folks could be influencing the data in a way we cannot see because we are
only observing a tiny portion of the bigger picture. We also notice that males use the bikes more than women.
Considering the time of the year, there could be personal preferences that affect males and females in a way
that could be influencing the data. As a pure assumption, maybe females do not want to sweat riding a bike
to get to their destination, whereas a male may possibly not mind as much which could lead to the difference
between the usage of the bikes between males and females. This could also be wrong, but it is also important
to understand that the visualization of the data we see is just a simple correlation, especially when
considering business tactics to attract more users.
     Couple visualizations that could also be useful to construct would be to compare Trips by Birth Year
by Gender (Weekday per Hour) which may provide some more data on the age ranges for males and females that
are biking. For some speculation we may see the age range between 25-55 year old with high traffic around
5pm to 7pm may help solidify the idea that people that are using the bikes are likely to be getting out of
work to get to their subways. Another visualization that may be useful would be to observe which locations
have the highest amount of users at the time of the day.
